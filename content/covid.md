Your safety is of utmost priority to us. In an effort to protect all drivers and passengers, Durham Drives has established a set of COVID-19 requirements which will be universally enforced.

* Masks, provided by us, should be worn at all times. 
* Car windows will remain open throughout the rides. 
* Drivers will disinfect their car between rides. 
* Hand sanitizer will be available. 

Worried about car safety? As illustrated in the graphic below, keeping the windows down even a few inches will make an impactful difference on potential COVID-19 spread. 

If you have any additional questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to reach out.
