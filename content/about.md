Durham Drives is a grassroots non-profit founded by Durham community members in 2020. Our goal is to provide free, safe, and well-organized personal transportation to and from voting locations throughout Early Voting and Election Day.

**Why is voter transportation important?**

In the 2016 election, an estimated 15 million registered Americans were unable to vote because they lacked transportation to the polls. Data show that young, diverse cities like Durham are hit hardest by this issue. Even worse, the coronavirus pandemic has limited public transportation options that many voters relied on in past elections. Providing safe, reliable transportation to the polls is more important this year than ever.

**Why is Durham important?**

Durham has the power to swing North Carolina. In 2016, the number of registered voters in Durham County who didn’t end up voting was approximately equal to half of Donald Trump’s margin of victory in the state.
